        <h1>You can do it!</h1>

        <p>
        Nobody’s <em>born</em> smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra. <br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.                <br>
        <strong>There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong>                       <br>
        <strong>And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.</strong>            <br>
        Thankfully, we are <em>born</em> to learn.                                                  <br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.                           <br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.                                                 <br>
        Until one day, you walk.                                                                    <br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.                                <br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.                                  <br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.                               <br>
        <strong>This. is. <em>learning.</em></strong>                                               <br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it.                                                             <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.                                                                 <br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe                          <br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.                              <br>
        <em>Whoever</em> you are, <em>wherever</em> you are.                                        <br>
        </p>

        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:                                                            <br>
        <strong>You can learn <em>anything.</em></strong>
